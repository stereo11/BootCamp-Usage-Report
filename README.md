# BootCamp-Usage-Report
Insights on the usage of BootCamp. UNCC has in-house BootCamp courses for Data Science and Business Analytics students. Recently, the School of Data Science took a DataCamp subscription for students. This app will help to decide whether to move BootCamp courses to DataCamp courses.

**Streamlit app**: https://stereo11-bootcamp-usage-report-main-3ip1f2.streamlit.app

The app has three pages:
**Home**: Introduction
**Overall Enrollment Page**: It contains the overall enrollment trend of students
**Course-wise Usage Analysis**: Course-wise trend of Usage of BootCamp.

# Data Preparation
The raw data is collected from the canvas. The BootCamp courses are created on Canvas. Students request to enroll in BootCamp via Google from the present on the School of Data Science website.

Extracted data from 3 places:
**Google Form Responses**
**Grades Data from the canvas page for each of the courses**
**Activity Data from Canvas for each of the courses**

I have performed Data Cleaning and Data Wrangling.

# Future Development
Making data reading dynamic. When data updates on Canvas (any activity happens on Canvas), the graphs on the app should get updated. Real-time updates will make it easy to track the usage of BootCamp.
